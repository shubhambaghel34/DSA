# JavaScript Interview Prep

This repository is a **complete JavaScript interview preparation kit** containing:
- Core JavaScript concepts with definitions, code snippets, and output-based questions
- Real-world examples
- LeetCode problems for practice
- Coding standards and best practices
- Common design patterns used in JavaScript

---

## Contents

### 1. `var`, `let`, `const`
- Scope, hoisting, re-declaration, re-assignment
- Code examples + console outputs
- Tricky scenarios with loops, TDZ, and global binding

### 2. Closures
- Basic closure behavior
- Closures in loops (`var` vs `let`)
- Closures with `setTimeout`
- Using closures for private data

### 3. Hoisting
- Variable and function hoisting
- Function expressions vs declarations
- Hoisting inside block scopes
- Shadowing and function overriding

### 4. Object References & Copying
- Assignment by reference
- Shallow copy vs deep copy
- Methods: spread, Object.assign, JSON methods, structuredClone
- `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()`

### 5. Inheritance
- Prototypal inheritance using `Object.create`
- Constructor function inheritance
- ES6 `class` and `extends`
- Method overriding and `super`
- Real-world example: `Product` → `DiscountedProduct`

### 6. `this` Keyword
- Global scope, object methods, arrow functions
- Constructor functions and classes
- call, apply, bind
- Losing `this` reference

### 7. Spread & Rest Operators
- Spread in arrays and objects
- Rest in function parameters and destructuring
- Mixing spread and rest
- Shallow copy behavior

### 8. Promise Methods
- `Promise.all`, `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.any`, `Promise.race`
- Definitions + pseudo code examples
- Use cases for each

### 9. Shallow vs Deep Copy
- Differences in behavior
- Performance and memory implications
- Real-world impact example (shopping cart)

## Additional Sections

### 10. LeetCode Problems
- Hand-picked JavaScript-friendly coding challenges
- Problems that test data structures, algorithms, and language quirks
- Example categories: Arrays, Strings, Objects, Recursion, Promises, Async/Await

### 11. Coding Standards
- Consistent variable naming conventions
- ES6+ best practices
- Avoiding anti-patterns
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Comments and documentation style

### 12. Design Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory
- Observer
- Strategy
- Real-world JavaScript implementations for each

## How to Use
1. Open the `.js` file for each concept.
2. Run in Node.js or browser console.
3. Observe the output and read the theory comments.
4. For LeetCode problems, solve first without looking at solutions, then compare.
5. Review coding standards to improve code quality.
6. Study design patterns to strengthen system design skills.

## Tip for Interviews
- Don’t just memorize outputs — understand **why**.
- Change values, scopes, and function types to see how behavior changes.
- Practice explaining concepts in **one or two sentences** for quick answers.
- Solve at least 2–3 LeetCode problems daily.
- Relate design patterns to real-world scenarios you’ve worked on.
